Blockchain-based eVoting system leverages the security and transparency of blockchain technology to conduct secure and tamper-proof elections. By integrating MetaMask, a widely-used Ethereum wallet, and Polygon, a scalable blockchain platform, the system ensures seamless and low-cost transactions during the voting process.

In this system, voters authenticate themselves through MetaMask, allowing them to securely connect their wallet to the eVoting platform. Once authenticated, voters can cast their votes as transactions on the Polygon blockchain. The use of Polygon ensures faster transaction processing and significantly lower gas fees compared to the Ethereum mainnet, making it a cost-effective solution for large-scale elections.

Each vote is recorded as an immutable transaction on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and preventing any tampering or manipulation of the voting results. Additionally, the decentralized nature of the blockchain guarantees that no single entity can control or alter the outcome of the election.

This eVoting system offers a modern solution for secure, transparent, and efficient elections, harnessing the power of blockchain technology to uphold democratic principles.
